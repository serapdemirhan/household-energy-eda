# **Individual Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Household Energy Dynamics: Unveiling Energy Patterns and Solutions**

## Overview

This repository presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of household energy dynamics, aiming to uncover insights into energy consumption patterns across various building types. The analysis delves into a comprehensive dataset sourced from Open Power System Data, providing information on energy consumption, generation, and related parameters across different building types and appliances.

## Key Findings

1. **Highest Consumption Building Type:** Industrial 3, functioning as a research institute, exhibits the highest energy consumption, consuming approximately 1.2 MWh annually. Residential buildings demonstrate relatively consistent yearly consumption ranging from 3 kWh to 11 kWh.

2. **Solar Generation and Export:** Residential buildings, particularly Urban Residential 4, demonstrate significant potential for solar export, with surplus solar energy reaching up to 8.7 kWh annually. Notably, Industrial buildings exhibit lower autoconsumption percentages, indicating a higher reliance on grid electricity.

3. **Energy Usage Patterns:** Industrial buildings typically exhibit higher energy consumption due to the presence of heavy machinery and industrial processes. Residential buildings demonstrate stable usage patterns, with peaks in consumption aligned with daily routines.

4. **EV Charging Behavior:** EV charging patterns vary seasonally, with sessions predominantly occurring during morning and evening hours. Notably, September showcases prolonged charging durations, suggesting a shift in user behavior or operational requirements.

5. **Energy Storage Integration:** Integration of energy storage systems offers financial benefits to homeowners by capitalizing on favorable energy pricing and reducing dependency on the grid during peak hours. August emerges as a month with ample solar energy availability and heightened energy consumption, emphasizing the utility of energy storage systems.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Solar Integration:** Enhance solar generation capacity, especially for buildings with lower solar production, to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on the grid.

2. **Implement Energy Management Strategies:** Develop schedule-based energy management strategies to optimize energy usage and reduce peak demand periods.

3. **Promote Sustainable Practices:** Encourage the adoption of energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy solutions to promote sustainability and cost savings.

## Conclusion

The EDA of household energy dynamics provides valuable insights into energy consumption patterns, solar generation, and EV charging behavior across different building types. By understanding these patterns and implementing recommended strategies, stakeholders can optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and promote sustainable practices in the energy management sector.
